## Exploring mental health data

This project implements various algorithms that detect depression based on survey data. The models classify whether an individual is depressed or not using features such as age, sleep duration, and family history.

- Python 3.10.12
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - time (just for timing the training process)

The project can be ran directly on Jupyter Notebook. After running it you will be able to see multiple results and plots showing the performance of the various models.
